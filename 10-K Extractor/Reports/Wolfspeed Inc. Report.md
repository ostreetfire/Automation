--- Key Risks ---


## Market ##
--------------------

- Risks related to our global operations, including global macroeconomic and market risks
  Description: Our business may be adversely affected by the state of the global economy, uncertainties in global financial markets, our ability, or our customers' or suppliers' ability, to access funding, and possible trade tariffs and trade restrictions.
  Potential Impact: Could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and services and, accordingly, on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

- We are subject to risks related to international sales and purchases.
  Description: In fiscal 2024, 86% of our revenue was from outside the United States and we expect that revenue from international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue. Our international sales and purchases are subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade sanctions, trade barriers, trade embargoes, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the United States Export Administration Act.
  Potential Impact: Government restrictions on sales to certain foreign customers will reduce our revenue and profit related to those customers in the short term and could have a potential long-term impact.

- Industry Cyclicality and Pricing Fluctuations
  Description: The industries we serve are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards and fluctuations in product supply and demand. These fluctuations have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity, higher inventory levels and aggressive pricing actions by our competitors.
  Potential Impact: Material negative impact on business, results of operations or financial condition.


## Operational ##
-------------------------

- We face significant challenges managing our growth strategy.
  Description: Our potential for growth depends significantly on the adoption of our products within the markets we serve and for other applications, and our ability to affect this rate of adoption. In order to manage our growth and business strategy effectively relative to the uncertain pace of adoption, we must continue to: maintain, expand, construct and purchase adequate manufacturing facilities and equipment, as well as secure sufficient third party manufacturing resources, to meet customer demand; meet our production capacity and delivery commitments to our customers; manage an increasingly complex supply chain; expand the skills and capabilities of our current management team; add experienced senior level managers and executives; attract and retain qualified employees; expand the capability of our information systems; be successful in securing design-ins across our end markets; realize our expected local, state and federal government incentives; access capital markets to fund our growth initiatives; safeguard confidential information and protect our intellectual property; manage organizational complexity and communication; and execute, maintain and adjust the operational and financial controls that support our business.
  Potential Impact: If our contract manufacturers or other service providers do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors or fulfill customer demand. Such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or an impact on employee morale. Our operations may also be negatively impacted if any of these contract manufacturers or other service providers do not have the financial capability to meet our growing needs.

- Manufacturing and Demand Forecasting Risks
  Description: If product demand decreases or if we fail to forecast demand decreases or changes accurately, we may experience a mismatch between current product demand and manufactured product mix, adversely impacting our results, including due to higher costs resulting from lower factory utilization, causing higher fixed costs per unit produced. We may be required to recognize impairments on our long-lived assets or recognize excess inventory write-off charges, or excess capacity charges, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.
  Potential Impact: Lower margins, adverse impact on business and results of operations, recognition of impairments or write-off charges.

- Production Yield and Manufacturing Process Risks
  Description: The number of usable items, or yield, from our production processes may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including variability in process repeatability and control, contamination, equipment failure, power outages, fires, flooding, information or other system failures, lack of consistency and adequate quality and quantity of piece parts, inventory shrinkage or human errors, defects in production processes, and transitions or changes in our production process.
  Potential Impact: Decline in margins, adverse impact on operating results, inability to achieve acceptable yields.

- Risks Related to New Product Development and Acceptance
  Description: Our future success may depend on our ability to deliver new, higher performing and/or lower cost solutions for existing and new markets and for customers to accept those solutions. The development of new products is a highly complex process, and we have in some instances experienced delays in completing the development, introduction and qualification of new products which has impacted our results in the past.
  Potential Impact: Inability to deliver and introduce new products in a timely or cost effective manner, negative impact on business.

- Shareholder activism
  Description: We have been subject to shareholder activism and may be subject to such activism in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert managementâ€™s and our boardâ€™s attention and resources from our business.
  Potential Impact: Could result in substantial costs, disruption of business, loss of business opportunities, concern to customers, difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, and significant fluctuations in stock price.

- Catastrophic events and disaster recovery
  Description: A disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a natural disaster or severe weather event, health pandemic, or man-made catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, continuing production or performing other critical functions of our business.
  Potential Impact: Could severely affect ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely affect operating results.

- Attracting and retaining key employees
  Description: Hiring and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. If we are unable to staff sufficient and adequate personnel at our facilities, we may experience lower revenue or increased manufacturing costs.
  Potential Impact: Could harm results of operations, lower revenue, or increase manufacturing costs.

- Volatility and uncertainty from infectious disease outbreaks
  Description: We have significant manufacturing operations in the United States and contract manufacturing operations in Asia, which may be affected by the outbreak of infectious diseases or other similar public health threats and the measures to try to contain it.
  Potential Impact: Could limit ability to meet customer demand, lead to increased costs, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.

- Concentration of Revenue and Accounts Receivable
  Description: For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, two customers represented 24% and 13% of revenue, respectively. For the fiscal year ended June 25, 2023, two customers represented 22% and 14% of revenue, respectively. For the fiscal year ended June 26, 2022, three customers represented 24%, 14%, and 10% of revenue, respectively. Three customers accounted for 20%, 14%, and 11% of the accounts receivable balance as of June 30, 2024, and three customers accounted for 15%, 14%, and 13% as of June 25, 2023.
  Potential Impact: Significant reliance on a small number of customers for revenue and accounts receivable may expose the Company to risks if these customers reduce purchases or fail to pay.


## Supply Chain ##
--------------------------

- Supplier and Raw Material Risks
  Description: We depend on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services and equipment used in manufacturing our products. General shortages in the marketplace of certain raw materials or key components may adversely impact our business. In the past, we have experienced decreases in our production yields when suppliers have varied from previously agreed upon specifications or made other modifications we did not specify, which impacted our cost of revenue.
  Potential Impact: Disruption in manufacturing operations, increased costs, inability to meet commercial demand.


## Customer Concentration ##
------------------------------------

- Dependence on Limited Number of Customers and Distributors
  Description: We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and distributors, two of which individually represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2024. Many of our customer orders are made on a purchase order basis, which does not generally require any long-term customer commitments.
  Potential Impact: Negative impact on financial condition and results of operations if customers alter purchasing behavior or reduce orders.


## Product ##
---------------------

- Product Quality, Performance, and Recall Risks
  Description: If our products do not meet customer standards, we may be required to replace or rework the products.

  Potential Impact: Adverse effect on business, results of operations or financial condition.

- Risks Associated with Sale of RF Business
  Description: We are subject to risks associated with the sale of the RF Business to MACOM, including issues, delays or complications in completing required transition activities, restrictions and obligations under supply and transition services agreements, required payments of indemnification obligations, and failure to realize the full purchase price anticipated.
  Potential Impact: Adverse impact on operations, financial condition and business, limitation on ability to pursue additional strategic transactions.


## Cybersecurity ##
---------------------------

- Cybersecurity and Confidential Information Risks
  Description: We face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems on which we maintain proprietary and other confidential information. Our security measures may be breached as the result of industrial or other espionage actions, employee error, or cyber-attacks. We are also at risk of security breaches and disruptions occurring at third parties that we work with.
  Potential Impact: Adversely affect competitive position, loss of confidence, significant costs to remedy, business disruption, monetary or other losses.

- Cybersecurity risks
  Description: We maintain a cyber risk management program designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and respond to cybersecurity threats. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not identified a material cyber incident that would have a material impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition; however, the occurrence or scope of such events is not always immediately apparent and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a material cyber incident in the future.
  Potential Impact: Potential for material impact on business, results of operations, or financial condition in the event of a material cyber incident.


## Intellectual Property ##
-----------------------------------

- Intellectual Property Protection Limitations
  Description: Our existing patents are subject to expiration and re-examination and we cannot be sure that additional patents will be issued on any new applications or that our existing or future patents will not be successfully contested by third parties. We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights.
  Potential Impact: Adversely affect sales and brand, result in shift of customer preference, significant legal expense.


## Legal ##
-------------------

- Litigation Risks
  Description: We are often involved in litigation, primarily patent litigation. Defending against existing and potential litigation will likely require significant attention and resources and, regardless of the outcome, result in significant legal expenses.
  Potential Impact: Adversely affect results unless covered by insurance or recovered from third parties, potential liability for damage awards.

- Claims of Infringement
  Description: Our business may be impaired by claims that we, or our customers, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Litigation to determine the validity of patents or claims by third parties of infringement could result in significant legal expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management.
  Potential Impact: Required to pay substantial damages, indemnify customers, stop manufacture or sale of products, incur asset impairment charges, or obtain a license.

- Exclusive forum provisions in bylaws
  Description: Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state courts of North Carolina will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders.
  Potential Impact: Could limit shareholdersâ€™ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes; may incur additional costs if provision is found unenforceable.

- Patent Infringement Lawsuit by Purdue University
  Description: In October 2021, The Trustees of Purdue University filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,498,633 and 8,035,112. Purdue alleges willful infringement and seeks approximately $30 million in damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, treble damages for willful infringement, and attorneysâ€™ fees. Purdue withdrew all allegations as to the '112 Patent in August 2022. The Company denies the remaining allegations and has developed defenses including non-infringement, invalidity, and unenforceability. Discovery is expected to conclude in August 2024, with a trial likely in 2025. The Company is unable to estimate the possible range of loss at this time.
  Potential Impact: An unfavorable ruling could result in monetary damages or injunctions prohibiting the sale of certain products, potentially having a material adverse impact on the Companyâ€™s business, results of operations, and financial position.


## Accounting/Tax ##
----------------------------

- Impairment of Goodwill or Other Assets
  Description: Goodwill and other assets are reviewed for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded an impairment to assets held for sale associated with the then pending RF Business Divestiture of $144.6 million.
  Potential Impact: Recognition of a significant charge to earnings, adverse impact on results of operations.


## Regulatory ##
------------------------

- Regulatory and Standards Changes
  Description: The adoption of or changes in government and/or industry policies, standards or regulations relating to the efficiency, performance, vehicle range or other aspects of our products and the products in which they are utilized or integrated may impact the demand for our products.
  Potential Impact: Negative impact on demand for products, impact on business.


## Tax ##
-----------------

- Tax Rate and Credit Risks
  Description: Our future effective tax rates and our ability to obtain future tax credits may affect our results and financial condition due to a number of factors, including changes in tax laws, available tax credits, international tax rules, and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits.
  Potential Impact: Impact on net (loss) income or cash flows, impact on financial condition.


## Environmental ##
---------------------------

- Environmental Compliance Risks
  Description: The manufacturing, assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for any outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt.
  Potential Impact: Materially restrict business, adversely affect financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, risk of default and acceleration of indebtedness.


## Financial ##
-----------------------

- Capped call transactions may not prevent dilution
  Description: The capped call transactions may not prevent dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the 2028 Notes or the 2029 Notes. If the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments.
  Potential Impact: Potential dilution of common stock and/or unmitigated cash payments upon conversion of notes.

- Stock price volatility
  Description: Our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of significant fluctuations in our revenue, earnings and margins, and variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts.
  Potential Impact: Stock price may decline if operating results or margins are below expectations; significant fluctuations in stock price.

- Market value fluctuations and interest rate risk
  Description: We are exposed to market value fluctuations and inherent interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio. Investments may lose value and/or become illiquid regardless of their credit rating.
  Potential Impact: Impairment of investments or lower investment income could harm earnings.

--- Liquidity Information ---

## Management's Liquidity Assessment ##
We require cash to fund our operating expenses, debt service costs, working capital requirements and capital expenditures, including the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials, supplies and capital equipment, as well as outlays for research and development, strategic acquisitions and investments. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and marketable securities. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our current working capital will be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. With the strength of our working capital position, we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in the near-term expansion of our production capacity, further develop our product portfolio and, when necessary or appropriate, make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio or secure key intellectual properties. However, even with our strong working capital position, we expect to need additional funding to fully complete all of our intended capacity expansions.

## Key Metrics ##
  - Operating Cash Flow: -671.3
  - Working Capital: 0
  - Current Ratio: 0

## Credit Facilities ##
In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into the CRD Agreement with Renesas America, pursuant to which Renesas America agreed to provide us up to $2 billion in unsecured deposits, subject to certain conditions. We received an initial deposit of $1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a second deposit of $500 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third and final deposit of $500 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2023, we issued and sold a total of $1,750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes and $1,250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2030 Senior Notes. The total net proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Notes were $1,718.6 million, of which we used $273.9 million to fund the cost of entering into capped call transactions. The total net proceeds from the sale of the 2030 Senior Notes were approximately $1,149.3 million. In connection with the sale of our 2030 Senior Notes, we terminated the $125.0 million secured revolving line of credit prior to its scheduled maturity date of January 9, 2026.

## Capital Expenditures ##
  - Amount: 0
  - Notes: We expect to invest approximately $2.0 billion in total construction, equipment and other related costs for the new Mohawk Valley Fab facility, of which approximately $500 million is expected to be reimbursed over time by the State of New York Urban Development Corporation. As of June 30, 2024, we have spent approximately $1.2 billion and received $425.4 million in reimbursements. Additionally, we recently started construction on a new materials manufacturing facility in Siler City, North Carolina. We expect to invest approximately $2.3 billion in total construction, equipment and other related costs for the facility through fiscal 2025. As of June 30, 2024, we have spent approximately $1.3 billion.
  - Expectations: For fiscal 2025, we target approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of capital investment, which is primarily related to capacity and infrastructure projects to support longerâ€‘term growth and strategic priorities. This target is highly dependent on the timing and overall progress on the Mohawk Valley Fab and the construction of our new materials manufacturing facility in Siler City, North Carolina. Compared to fiscal 2024, our capital investment related to these new facilities during the next 12 months will be significantly less and will continue to decrease substantially as we complete the majority of construction related to this phase of our expansion efforts.

## 1. Reserves for Distributor Programs - Ship and Debit ##
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, products are sold to distributors at negotiated prices and the distributors are required to pay for the products purchased within the Companys standard commercial terms. Certain distributors are provided customer pricing arrangements under the Companys ship and debit program. Distributor sales approximate a quarter of total net revenue of $807.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. Management makes estimates of changes in selling prices when the corresponding product ships. These estimates are calculated based upon historical experience, product shipment analysis, current economic conditions, on-hand inventory at the distributor, and customer contractual arrangements. Accordingly, estimates for these rights are recognized at the time of sale as a contract liability and a reduction of product revenue. The associated reserves for ship and debit program to distributors make up a significant portion of the contract liabilities and distributor-related reserves account balance of $62.3 million. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to ship and debit reserves for distributor programs is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to current economic conditions, historical experience and on-hand inventory at the distributor. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements estimate of the reserves for the ship and debit program. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing managements process for determining the estimate for ship and debit reserve, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data inputs to the ship and debit reserve calculation, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to current economic conditions, historical experience and on-hand inventory at the distributor. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to current economic conditions, historical experience and on-hand inventory at the distributor involved evaluating whether the significant assumptions used by management were reasonable considering managements historical claim experience and whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.
