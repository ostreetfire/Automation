--- Key Risks ---


## Market/Operational ##
--------------------------------

- Reduced Demand and Increased Competition
  Description: Global economic malaise, reduced demand, and increased competition from China have acutely impacted performance, causing price drops and margin compression.
  Potential Impact: Lower revenue, compressed margins, and strained liquidity.


## Operational ##
-------------------------

- Long-term Take-or-Pay Contracts
  Description: Locked into uneconomic contracts due to market trough, forcing sales at a loss.
  Potential Impact: Further margin erosion and losses.


## Liquidity ##

  Description: Deferral of vendor payments led to a past-due accounts-payable wall of over $110 million, resulting in vendor pressure and risk of operational disruption.
  Potential Impact: Potential plant shutdown and severe operational disruption.


## Operational/Environmental ##
---------------------------------------

- Facility Disruptions
  Description: Fire at Pensacola, Texas freeze, and logistics delays at Wilson Lock caused operational disruptions and increased costs.
  Potential Impact: Decreased EBITDA, increased costs, and further liquidity strain.


## Credit/Financial ##
------------------------------

- Credit Downgrades
  Description: S&P and Moodyâ€™s downgraded Ascendâ€™s credit rating due to tight liquidity and upcoming maturities.
  Potential Impact: Increased vendor pressure, tighter trade terms, and higher cost of capital.

## Management's Liquidity Assessment ##
Ascend's liquidity position became increasingly severe in late 2024 due to operational disruptions, macroeconomic headwinds, and vendor payment deferrals. Cost-saving and liquidity management measures included headcount reduction, cost rationalization, sale leasebacks, factoring receivables, and inventory reduction. Despite these, a near-term capital infusion was required to avoid plant shutdown. DIP financing and stakeholder support are expected to provide sufficient liquidity during Chapter 11.
