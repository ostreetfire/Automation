## Case Overview ##

**Company Description:**
Ascend Performance Materials Holdings Inc. ("Ascend") is one of the largest, fully-
integrated producers of nylon, focusing primarily on the production and sale of nylon
6,6 (PA66) and its chemical intermediates and downstream outputs. PA66 is used in
applications requiring impact, heat, abrasion, and chemical resistance, such as heating
and cooling systems, air bags, batteries, and athletic apparel. Ascend's PA66 composes
approximately 40% of the global market for air bags and tires and is used in about 50%
of Lululemon's "Nulu" yoga pants and sports bras. The company operates eleven
manufacturing facilities across the United States, Mexico, Europe, and Asia, employs
about 2,200 people, and serves customers globally.

**Case Summary:**
Ascend Performance Materials Holdings Inc. and affiliated debtors filed voluntary
petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on April 21,
2025, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division (Case No. 25-90127). Joint administration and emergency hearings were
requested.

**Reasons for Filing:**
Ascend faced significant headwinds since mid-2022 due to global economic malaise,
reduced demand, and increased competition from China, which led to a sharp drop in PA66
prices and a compression of margins. The company also suffered from uneconomic long-term
contracts, persistent pricing pressure, and a series of one-time negative events in late
2024 and early 2025 (including a fire, a freeze, and logistics delays), which further
strained liquidity. By early 2025, overdue accounts payable exceeded $110 million,
vendors tightened terms, and credit ratings were downgraded, leading to a severe
liquidity crisis and the need for a near-term capital infusion.

**Restructuring Purpose & Go-Forward Plan:**
The main purpose of the bankruptcy is to implement a comprehensive deleveraging
transaction supported by key stakeholders, including ABL, Bridge, and Term Loan Lenders.
The company seeks approval for approximately $900 million in debtor-in-possession
financing (including $250 million in new-money loans) to stabilize operations, sustain
liquidity, and pursue a value-maximizing restructuring that will allow Ascend to emerge
as a healthy, well-capitalized enterprise.

## Financial Condition ##

**Assets:**
- **Cash and Equivalents:** None
- **Accounts Receivable:** Approximately $152 million as of April 7, 2025.
- **Inventory:** Approximately $228 million as of March 31, 2025.

**Liabilities:**
- **Trade Payables:** Past-due accounts payable wall of more than $110 million at its apex in late February 2025.

**Funded Debt Structure:**
| Facility Name | Principal | Total Outstanding |
|---|---|---|
| ABL Facility | $346 million | $348 million |
| Bridge Facility | $120 million | $150 million |
| Term Loan Facility | $1,043 million | $1,072 million |
| Capital Leases and Sale Leasebacks | $348 million | $350 million |
| China Debt | $157 million | $158 million |

**Historical Performance:**
**Summary:** Ascend demonstrated strong financial performance with average annual revenue of $2.7
billion since 2020. However, since 2022, the company has experienced a significant
decline: PA66 prices dropped by approximately 45% from their COVID-peak, gross profit
margin compressed by almost 4%, and EBITDA declined by about 56%. The company's EBITDA
margin is near its lowest level in almost a decade.
**Impact of Specific Events:** A fire at the Pensacola facility in December 2024 led to an EBITDA loss of approximately
$6 million in Q1 2025. A Texas freeze in January 2025 and logistics delays at Wilson
Lock further impacted operations, with the latter causing $4 million in additional costs
in the first two quarters of 2025. Collectively, these events decreased Q1 2025 EBITDA
by approximately $21 million.

## Prepetition Transactions & Events ##

**Cost Rationalization Measures:**
Beginning near the end of 2022, Ascend implemented several cost rationalization
measures, including reducing headcount (SGA&T headcount reduced by more than 24% since
January 2024, generating nearly $60 million in savings), imposing operating cost-cutting
measures, consolidating its manufacturing footprint (exiting the Greenwood facility,
shuttering the Tilburg facility), and reducing manufacturing costs (cutting fixed
manufacturing costs by approximately $100 million in 2024).

**Liquidity Management:**
Liquidity management exercises included imposing strict governance controls on spending,
deferring vendor payments, entering into approximately $250 million in sale leaseback
transactions for U.S. assets, factoring certain foreign accounts receivables, and
reducing inventory levels. The company also entered into a receivables agreement with
JPMorgan to monetize receivables from Honeywell, and deferred vendor payments, resulting
in a peak accounts payable wall of over $110 million.

**Bridge Financing:**
**Details:** The Bridge Facility is a super-senior term loan facility provided by an ad hoc group of
term loan lenders. Initially, on March 7, 2025, $40 million was committed and provided,
with the ability to upsize by another $60 million. On March 25, 2025, an additional $35
million was provided, and on April 1, 2025, another $45 million, bringing the total
outstanding to $150 million as of the Petition Date. The facility matures on March 7,
2026, and is secured by additional guarantees and asset collateral.
**Purpose:** The Bridge Facility was intended to bridge the company's liquidity needs, provide time
to prepare for a potential chapter 11 filing, and avoid a value-destructive plant
shutdown.

**Forbearance Agreements:**
On March 31, 2025, the company entered into a forbearance agreement with ABL lenders,
and on April 1, 2025, with Term Loan lenders, under which the lenders agreed to forbear
from exercising remedies (other than charging default interest) until April 30, 2025.
The ABL forbearance also initiated a cash dominion period, giving the ABL agent control
over the company's deposit accounts.
