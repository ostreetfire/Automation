## Case Overview ##

**Company Description:**
Wolfspeed, Inc. is a leading developer and manufacturer of wide-bandgap semiconductors,
specializing in silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) materials. Its products
serve a broad range of applications including electric vehicles, motor drives, power
supplies, military communications, radar, satellite, and telecommunications. The company
operates through two main segments: Materials (SiC bare wafers, epitaxial wafers, GaN
epitaxial layers) and Power Devices (SiC Schottky diodes, MOSFETs, power modules).
Wolfspeed's SiC components enable faster, more efficient electric vehicles and more
efficient solar and wind energy systems. The company is headquartered in Durham, North
Carolina, with manufacturing facilities in Durham, Siler City (NC), Marcy (NY), and
Fayetteville (AR). Wolfspeed, Inc. is publicly listed with its common stock registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.

**Case Summary:**
On July 1, 2025, Wolfspeed, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Wolfspeed Texas, LLC
filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States
Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division (Case No. 25-90163 (CML)). The cases are jointly administered. Prior to filing,
on June 22, 2025, the Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with
Consenting Creditors after months of negotiations. The Debtors requested and were
granted interim relief for the use of Cash Collateral as of June 30, 2025.

**Reasons for Filing:**
The company faced significant challenges including the impending maturity of the 2026
Convertible Notes and uncertainty regarding receipt of CHIPS Act funding. Substantial
capital investments in capacity expansion projects such as the Mohawk Valley Fab and
Siler City Facility increased leverage. Delays and uncertainty in CHIPS Act funding
complicated liquidity forecasting. As of March 2025, Wolfspeed had approximately $6.5
billion in funded debt, negative adjusted EBITDA, and annual cash interest expense of
about $400 million. Unsuccessful out-of-court restructuring efforts led to the decision
to file for chapter 11 to implement a comprehensive deleveraging transaction.

**Restructuring Purpose & Go-Forward Plan:**
The bankruptcy aims to implement a consensual restructuring of Wolfspeed's balance sheet
supported by key creditors under a Restructuring Support Agreement. The Plan seeks to
reduce total debt from approximately $6.75 billion to $2.12 billion and annual cash
interest expense from $400 million to $160 million. General unsecured claims are
expected to be paid in full, with operations continuing with minimal interruption. The
Plan includes a rights offering, issuance of New 2L Convertible Notes, New 2L Takeback
Notes, New Renesas 2L Takeback Convertible Notes, and New Common Stock, as well as
management incentive plans (MIP and LTIP). It also addresses treatment of various
classes of claims and interests, employee compensation and benefits, and post-
transaction governance. The company aims to emerge from chapter 11 with a healthier
balance sheet, improved liquidity, and to address regulatory approval requirements,
particularly concerning Renesas.
